<h1> Take away from Lesson 1</h1>

<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<p>The web is possible due to your computer being connected online and using the hypertext transfer protocol (http) 
  to translate text mainly html, from the server back to your computer.</p>
  
 <b>HTML Coding Basics</b> <br> 
 -Note that I will use curly brackets <b>{ }</b> to replace < >.
 <p><b>Tags / Elements -<br></b> What is used to tell the <em>stupid computer</em> what to do and when to do it. When writing a line of code it is called an element. 
 For instance when you start a paragraph tag{p}, write some text, then close the paragraph tag{/p}. That would be considered an element.
 This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">video</a> explains it in more detail. </p>
  
 <p><b>Void Tag -<br></b> A void tag never needs to be closed. An example of a void tag would be the break line tag {br}.</p>
  
 <p><b>Attributes -<br></b> Add additonal value into a tag. {tag attribute="value"} Content{/tag}</p>
  
 <p><b>Inline and Block Elements -</b> <br><b>Inline elements</b> will normally stay inline with other inline elements. 
 Athough they sometimes can start with a new line, but will never end with a new line.
 <br><br><b>Block elements</b> will <em>start</em> and <em> end</em> with a new line. Basically creating an invisible block around the element.</p>
  
  <p><b>Computers are stupid -<br></b> This I think is a really good to keep in mind when coding. 
  You need to tell the computer exactly what you want it to do and in the order you want to do it. Also known as writting in the correct syntax.</p>
